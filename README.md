# Statistical Analysis of Airbnb Listings

## Introduction 

Airbnb has revolutionized the way people travel by providing access to unique and affordable accommodations in various destinations around the world. As the platform continues to grow, it's becoming increasingly important to understand the factors that drive customer behavior and influence the selection of rental properties. This analysis will focus on several key variables, including host rating, Super Host status, price, location, property type, number of bedrooms, and amenities offered, and their impact on a customer's decision when choosing a rental property on Airbnb. 

The insights gained from this analysis will provide valuable information for both property owners and travelers. Property owners can use the information to optimize their listings, making them more appealing to potential guests, while travelers can use it to make informed decisions and find the perfect rental property that meets their needs and preferences. By understanding customer behavior and selection criteria, Airbnb can continue to provide an enjoyable and memorable rental experience for all its users. 

## Purpose 

The online short-term rental marketplace Airbnb has completely changed how people travel and locate lodging. It's critical to comprehend how the platform is being used in various places, including Toronto, given its rising popularity. We'll examine the Toronto Airbnb listings in more detail in this research to learn more about elements like price, home type, and location. Both Airbnb hosts attempting to optimize their listings and tourists trying to make educated judgements might benefit from this information. This report offers a thorough picture of the Airbnb market in Toronto, whether you're an experienced user or just getting started in terms of a super host. 

## Dataset 

The team will be using raw data from Airbnb for Toronto provided through the “Inside Airbnb” http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data portal. Inside Airbnb data is structured and collects information about Airbnb listings from various cities and releases it so people can examine how Airbnb is being used around the world. For this project, the data for Toronto, Canada, is going to be used. The dataset includes data on the owner(host) of the property and about the property itself. Each entry in the dataset is a listing. Each listing includes data on the owner(host) of the listing and data about the listing itself, including, the nightly charge, the type of property, the neighbourhood where the listing is located, etc. 

The data contains 14 columns and 16761 rows. There are 13 attributes and “host_is_superhost”, is the response variable to check whether it is a super host or not. Minimum_nights are the minimum number of nights a renter is required to book to stay in the listing. Price is the nightly charge for staying in the listing.
